## Hi, I’m Dima 👋
#### An aspiring front-end engineer trying to make the web a better place.
Actively looking for a Front-End junior role / intership!

### Writing ✍
I write about everything front-end and more in [my blog](https://dmitryanisov.com).

### Checkout my repos 🚧
- Being a gym rat that I am I couldn't think of anything better than building a [Workout Tracker Telegram Bot](https://github.com/dim-anis/tg-workout-tracker).
- I love making pizza a little bit more than I like eating it so I had to build a [Pizza Dough Calculator](https://github.com/dim-anis/pizza-calculator).
